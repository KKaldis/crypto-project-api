# ðŸ§  Crypto Project Intelligence API

A **work-in-progress** backend API designed to support deep analysis of crypto projects. It aggregates data from multiple sourcesâ€”such as GitHub, Telegram, Discord, and othersâ€”to provide insights into a project's activity, transparency, and credibility.

## ðŸ§© About the Project

This backend is **meant to be used alongside a browser-based crawler extension**.  
As users browse various crypto-related websites, the extension will send project entries (like URLs, tags, or metadata) to this API. These entries will then be analyzed through various modules.

A dedicated logic layer for **data structuring, deduplication, enrichment, and persistent storage** is planned, but **not yet implemented**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KKaldis/crypto-project-api.git
cd crypto-project-api
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Setup your environment file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on http://localhost:<PORT> (based on your .env settings).


## ðŸ“˜ .env Example
```env
PORT='3666'
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL=''
GITHUB_OCTOKIT_TOKEN=''
GITHUB_BASE_URL='https://api.github.com'
TELEGRAM_BASE_URL='https://api.telegram.org'
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=''
MONGO_BASE_URL=''
MONGO_BASE_NAME=''
VERSION=''
NODE_ENV='DEVELOPMENT'
DISCORD_API_BASE_URL="https://discord.com/api/v9/"
DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```

## ðŸ“˜ API Documentation
Once the server is running, explore the interactive API docs at:
http://localhost:<PORT>/api-docs
This provides a live interface to test and understand available routes and responses.

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer
This project is under active development. Many components are still being built, including the browser extension, data logic layer, and advanced analytics modules.

We are working on modularizing this further for better maintainability and expansion into other blockchains and social platforms.

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions
We welcome PRs, suggestions, and feature requests!

If youâ€™re interested in adding new endpoints, improving architecture, or building the extension-to-backend communication protocolâ€”feel free to open an issue or contribute directly.
